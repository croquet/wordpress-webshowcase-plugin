== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above. This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation." Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

== To Do ==

- Investigate if BlockMover can be used for my own component, so that those lines can be moved with it.
  If not, take the design of the button and add code.
- Add delete button, and add add button.

== Questions for Experts ==
- Is having settings in side bar (as opposed to make them visible in the pane itself the way to go?
- If We make a dropzone or file upload work, is it going to work across different installation to upload pdf and mov (or mp4) video files?
- How do I get the current content of an asset file, and check if it is the same as the content it is going to create?
- There are other DropZones already installed and my own cannot handle the drop event. Is there a common way to workaround?
- The package.json and block.json may have some common convention people use. I'd like to get some review on that.
- Or publshing a component, is it easy to register and submit but then not announce it widely until we do "alpha" test by ourselves and friends?
