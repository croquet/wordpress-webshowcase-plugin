## Description

Croquet Metaverse Web Showcase is a new WordPress block which allows people to embed a multiuser, collaborative, 3D space into a WordPress site. A WordPress author can drag images, videos, and PDF files into the block to add their content into the virtual 3D space.

Installation is easy. Search for "Croquet Web Showcase" from the plugin installation page.
After installing the plugin, make sure that you have the Croquet API Key for your site. You can create a key for free on https://croquet.io/keys. A key looks like 15kkttz5HqJ4mDycjupJA5eiF2CMhdvIgexample.

Then create the Croquet Metaverse Web Showcase Block in the Block editor. That looks like the first screenshot. Open the sidebar settings for the block by clicking on the the gear icon at the top right corner on the editing page and clicking on the block. You paste the Croquet API into the API Key settings and you are good to go.

There are two default assets already set. We recommend to preview the page at this point. You should see a 3D art gallery space with two images.

When this works, go back to the editing page, and remove the default contents by pressing the "X" buttons on the row. You can drag your own assets into the block to add them. You can rearrange them.
